âš½ FIFA 26 Player Data Analysis
ðŸ“„ Overview

This project is a simple Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using the FIFA 26 Player Dataset from Kaggle.
The goal is to discover interesting patterns in player data â€” such as top players, best countries, and skill differences by position.
All code was written in Google Colab (Python) using Pandas and Seaborn for visualization.

ðŸ“Š Dataset Information

Explored age and overall rating distributions.

Find Top Players & Nations

Listed top 10 players by overall rating.

Found top 10 nations with the highest average rating (countries with â‰¥30 players).

Analyze Player Positions
